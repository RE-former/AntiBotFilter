# AntiBotFilter

This is a very simple verification system plugin that shows a user a GUI with colors. If the user selects the correct answer, he gets granted to the server, otherwise he gets kicked. There is also an IP check with an API that you can disable in the config along with other things. More updates are to come soon.
